## Make filesystem fixture contracts truthful

Use `fixture.fsp` for Promise file operations. `fixture.fs` exposes callback, synchronous and stream
operations without inheriting conflicting Promise signatures. Missing callbacks now fail explicitly.
Memory fixtures reject `fs/tempDir` overrides; disk fixtures accept `tempDir` but always own native fs.

## Keep process-owned build orchestration inside the official CLI

`runWithTsdown` is no longer exported from the public `/build` entry. Official CLI cooperation uses
an explicit `/internal/cli` allowlist. Custom build hosts use the public `pluginPackage` preset.
The CLI runner owns one-shot bundle cleanup, including hook failures; watch resources, configuration
restarts and terminal interaction remain owned by the command process.
