# Native modules delivery and owned Vite execution

Replace Host dynamic source execution with pure `@pluxel/host/sources` declarations. Native startup accepts a precompiled application module path and binds shared packages before evaluating its factory and fixed imports, then scans sources once, validates shared package versions and loaded artifact inventories, and reports next-start consumption. `createHost()` accepts evaluated Plugins only.

Rename Host Dev to `@pluxel/host-vite`. Its root configures the same update driver for development and production; `/run` owns production startup and close, while `/console` remains development-only. Execution diagnostics explicitly distinguish native/Vite, fixed/source, artifact and update behavior. Workbench runtime artifact attachments move to `/vite`.

Execution and build options are captured at owner creation. Source admission consistently rejects linked entry leaves with a located error. Host-vite observes rapid file repairs and drains accepted watcher work; production close releases remaining resources after failures and preserves its rejection on repeated calls. Artifact candidate commit and rollback are synchronous contracts checked for JavaScript callers too.

Development startup distinguishes the workspace used by CLI doctor from the member package that declares the CLI. It preserves explicit configuration roots and project installation boundaries, and reports invalid setup through the existing doctor.

Add modules application delivery with an exported factory/product, unique compiled public exports, unchanged canonical identities and verified Node/Workbench inventories. Standalone remains the default fixed-catalog build. Generated hosts use modules with native startup and an independent production Vite example; CLI resources and documentation follow these contracts. Removed entry points and fields have no aliases.

Standalone delivery preserves traced native libraries in the `@pluxel` namespace through explicit residual selection; Core/Host identities remain bundled and traced duplicate framework copies are rejected. Native startup reuses successful namespace admission within its loader and stores cached entry closures as shared immutable prefix views. Vite validates its completed initial source observation once, while live updates and source consumers retain current validation.

Official published Plugins declare their artifact root and Node/Workbench inventory capabilities so installed consumers validate the compiled artifacts owned by the actual loaded package.

Standalone Workbench builds select producer and Content owners from the validated fixed catalog using the existing compiler's constructor bindings. Unselected definitions do not read renderer/Markdown inputs, build UI, or copy package artifact trees; selected inventories retain strict validation.
