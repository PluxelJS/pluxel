## @pluxel/core@1.1.0

### Compose explicitly installed runtime services

Host creation is asynchronous and prepares an explicit service list before Plugin admission. Service
plans validate identity, properties, reserved Core members and dependencies before creating resources;
preparation and shutdown preserve dependency order and clean partially prepared resources on failure.
Core provides its own host composition entry, optional service type catalogs and synchronous token-based
Context.require(), with stable missing-capability and access errors.

Persistence and Vault move to dedicated @pluxel/services entries. Encrypted Vault explicitly requires
Persistence and flushes pending writes during Host cleanup; read-only deployment bindings need neither.
Import Persistence helpers and Vault types from their service entries. The Runtime package is removed;
servicesPreset() supplies the official default service composition.

### Preserve identity through development and generated metadata

Host development passes service declarations through the shared Host path. Service declaration changes
replace the Host; failed asynchronous preparation creates a fresh compensation Host from the previous
successful declaration. Native ESM and evaluated plugins share official service identity. Plugin/config
metadata defaults to the Core toolchain, without requiring Runtime in independent service applications.

### Unify plugin authoring and service ownership

Plugin examples and official packages import the Core authoring model directly. Commands, Node modules
and Workers are explicitly installed services; their tokens, declarations and types live at the service
entries. Worker installations declare their Node module dependency. servicesPreset() combines these
installations without introducing a second application or lifecycle model. The default Core author entry no longer forwards raw
Context host construction helpers; service authors use @pluxel/core/host.

Host exposes generic configuration get/validate/patch/reset through its existing coordinator, preserving
Core validation, storage confirmation and generation notification. Management delegates to these
operations and retains browser report projection. Vault operations participate in owner and root
admission: stop drains accepted work, rejects cached handles and flushes after pending storage IO.

### Use standard tsdown application plugins

Applications configure entry and output through tsdown and install pluxel() from @pluxel/rolldown in
the ordinary plugins list. This replaces the application preset in the build subpath, retaining the
same freezer, artifact assembly and deployment validation.

### Separate business HTTP from management

Install elysia() from @pluxel/services/elysia and use ctx.require(ElysiaApp) for the native generation-owned
Elysia application. Independent Hosts expose business requests through createElysiaHandler(host),
without management, Workbench or a listener. Official presets use the same installation and publication stages.
Host services may bind fixed Core lifecycle stages before Plugin admission; no dynamic registration or
secondary graph commit is introduced.

### Persist and manage Host state directly

Host owns configRecords and state.initial, optional borrowed document storage, read-only handling and
flush failure reporting. Status snapshots and retained lifecycle diagnostics, startup intent, provider
selection and fork operations share the same Host coordinator in standalone and default applications.
Service removeNodeMetadata hooks run before durable fork removal; failure retains the stopped fork so
cleanup can be retried.

Database moves from @pluxel/runtime/database to @pluxel/services/database. Install an explicit backend
from @pluxel/services/database/pglite or /postgres. Driver dependencies are optional and only the chosen
backend is imported. Missing installation reports the standard capability error. Database acquisition
and cached handle operations participate in root and owner drain; closing waits for accepted transactions.

### Share management, Workbench and development tooling

The authenticated management endpoint/client, Workbench publication/browser code and logging backend
move to independently selected packages. Vault administration is an ordinary explicitly installed Plugin.
Host-dev owns the existing local console executor and typed script surface at @pluxel/host-dev/console;
its Vite Host plugin accepts devConsole: true. Node and Workbench artifacts use ordinary Vite plugins and
the shared Host candidate boundary. Canceled management work is rejected before queued execution starts;
an admitted operation retains its existing completion and persistence semantics.

### Share startup declarations and transport ownership

Application startup and service test-host factories await the same createHost service preparation path. Official
plugins import validation and RPC contracts from their owning packages, removing the Runtime peer
where no runtime implementation is used. Services owns the Node HTTP/WebSocket carrier; Host-dev owns
the development console, and queued management mutations honor cancellation before admission.

The root `@pluxel/services` entry contains only `standardServices()` and its base service types. Import the official `servicesPreset()` from `@pluxel/services/preset`; its Management and Logging configuration types remain owned by those packages and do not leak into independent base-service consumers. Generated hosts and current examples use the explicit preset entry.

### Make effects transactions and config snapshots match their ownership contracts

Effects transactions reject overlapping siblings, require nesting through the active tx, and revoke tx views after their callback settles. Rollback releases only resources owned by that transaction; tx.dispose() no longer disposes the parent scope. Acquire checks admission before starting and releases resources that arrive after withdrawal. Callers must await child transactions and acquisition promises.

Plugin configs.use() now exposes the existing deeply frozen output as ConfigSnapshot, including readonly nested arrays and tuples. Copy configuration into owned mutable state before editing it.

### Preserve invalid persistent Host documents

Host startup now rejects malformed or unsupported persisted config and runtime state documents instead of creating `.broken.*` copies and replacing the originals with empty state. The original document stays untouched; repair it or restore a backup before restarting. A failed load also keeps the store unready and blocks direct mutation.

### Complete Host ownership and retire the Runtime package

HostApplication is the single application contract for development and production. Environment facts
move to @pluxel/host/environment; applications explicitly select configuration and Vault deployment
inputs with `envBinding()` and `fileBinding()`. Production launchers use Host plus explicitly composed
HTTP services. The Runtime package,
its parallel Vite driver, production adapters, toolchain aliases and author barrels are removed.

RootContext.require accepts installed root/all capabilities; owner Context.require accepts owner/all
capabilities. Root references carry root authority and are not a sandbox. The development console can
therefore use dev.ctx.require without a separate service resolver or a new require namespace.

Management commands are an explicit @pluxel/services/management/commands service installed by servicesPreset.
Generic Commands and standardServices keep an initially empty command catalog. Regression suites,
benchmarks and type probes now live with their owning packages; test hosts use actual Host service plans.

The CLI no longer installs Workbench as an unused direct dependency; applications select it through
their own service composition.

### Keep Plugin label projection independent of Host

Move the shared pure Plugin label functions to Core. Logging formatters and Management catalog projection now consume Core directly; Host no longer re-exports the implementation through its internal entry.

Remove manager creation, active-owner lookup, and Context binding functions from the Logging public root. Framework integrations retain the existing internal entry. Applications install `logging()` as a Host service and access the installed manager through `Logging` or `host.ctx.logging`.

### Add bounded third party version contracts

Add the optional `@pluxel/core/better-result` entry with all named exports from the shared `better-result` dependency.
Check the exact `capnweb` peer, development and installed versions when a plugin package publishes a
Workbench View or Attachment target. Move Vault Admin's `capnweb` to a peer and development dependency.
Record target publication in package metadata so static builds and dynamic source loaders share the
host `RpcTarget` constructor only for those publishers. Diagnose deployment version mismatches before
target evaluation. Improve the Workbench identity diagnostic and use Result within Auth credential
preparation while preserving its portable setup replies.

### Refresh the Workbench Federation profile

Use Module Federation Vite 1.22.1 with Runtime, SDK and React Bridge 2.9.1 and Mantine 9.6.3. The exact producer and Shell compatibility checks remain enforced; rebuild renderer artifacts with the updated profile.

Keep shared-surface import analysis, application-root scheduling and isolated declaration caches: real Mantine producer builds and upstream shared state still require these boundaries with the updated plugin.

### Ship optional service UI plugins from one package

Import `VaultAdminPlugin` from `@pluxel/services/plugins`. The separate `@pluxel/vault-admin`
package is retired before this release. Vault resources remain owned by the explicitly installed
service; the optional Plugin publishes the Workbench view and uses the authenticated Management
session. Starter and maintenance applications use the same public entry.

Concrete Plugins may be exported from explicit package subpaths. Their canonical identity contains
the package name, export path and named export. A constructor exported through multiple public
paths or names is rejected, as are cross-package Plugin re-exports. Package root identities remain
unchanged. Compilation, inspection, persistence and packaged Workbench artifacts share this contract.

### Bind deployment inputs and preserve editable configuration layers

Application factories declare `envBindings` and `fileBindings` with `envBinding` and
`fileBinding`, importing the configuration and Vault root schemas explicitly. Binding helpers
check schema input keys; Plugins keep `configs.use(schema)` without static schema fields.
Bindings require Valibot schemas, matching the Host's input projection at runtime.
Host verifies that a config binding references the same schema as the Plugin's lowered declaration.
Static builds derive `.env.example` from the explicit schemas without evaluating factories or
reading deployment values. Published declarations provide field completion without compiler plugins.
Config merges base, saved values, and environment overrides recursively, replacing arrays.
Only management edits persist. Environment-controlled paths reject writes, and management
responses expose value-free source metadata. The previous environment bootstrap helper and
implicit `PLUXEL_CONFIG` snapshot are removed.

### Use structured Vault snapshots with durable writes and deployment records

Vault KV reads return immutable snapshots with revision, source, and writability. Writes support
expected revisions, batches publish only after durable commit, and owner-scoped subscriptions
observe committed changes. Environment/file records are whole-record read-only overlays;
bindings-only installations need neither Persistence nor disk keys. Encrypted Vault takes an
explicit deployment identity. Named namespaces are owner-local; legacy global namespaces require
explicit owner migration mappings. Legacy documents migrate to collision-checked KV keys.
Vault root schemas validate record keys and complete records as an application startup contract;
Plugin hot replacement does not change that contract or repeat input transforms.

Official authentication and storage plugins export their deployment schemas, consume structured
credential records, and observe updates. The showcase and local applications migrate their
credential and account workflows.

Vault administration displays KV and blob counts for the unified storage model.

### One production-backed plugin test host

Import `createTestHost()` from `@pluxel/test`. Services are explicit and default to an empty list;
`workbench: true` adds the local test plane to the same host. Use `start/stop/restart`, typed batch
starts, catalog transactions, dependency overrides, configuration and native resource disposal.
The public Core and Services test factories are removed; Core graph harnesses remain internal.

Node/Worker source tests automatically attach the real artifact compiler when Node services are
selected without an explicit artifact source. Each host owns its compiler, temporary cache and
cleanup. Explicit packaged artifacts remain authoritative. The Vitest preset enables legacy
decorators and keeps project plugins explicit; separately built Node artifacts do not inherit
arbitrary Vitest plugins.

Official tests, generated plugin examples and testing documentation use the unified root entry.
